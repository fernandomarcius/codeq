# Tenant claim threat model

Scope: validated token to tenant-scoped HTTP/gRPC queue access. Protected assets
are task payloads, results, subscriptions, QueueTopic policies, rate limits, and
physical tenant prefixes. Trust changes at token producer to validator,
validator to claim resolver, and resolved tenant to storage/provider keys.

## STRIDE and abuse cases

| Threat | Abuse case | Control | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spoofing | attacker signs with another key, issuer, or audience | configured JWKS signature, issuer, audience, and expiry validation | JWKS validator tests |
| Tampering | token contains `tid=payments` and a legacy alias for another tenant | all supplied aliases must agree exactly after trimming | conflict/property/fuzz tests |
| Repudiation | transport resolves the same token differently | one resolver for HTTP, producer gRPC, and worker gRPC | compile and compatibility matrix |
| Information disclosure | malformed tenant escapes a key prefix or selects an empty/global scope | DNS-label validation; missing/malformed values fail closed before handlers | unsafe/missing claim tests |
| Denial of service | oversized or unexpected claim types trigger parser failure | bounded JWT parsing plus type checks; resolver never reflects raw values | fuzz tests |
| Elevation of privilege | subject fallback overrides a bad alias | fallback only when every supported alias is absent | blank/non-string tests |
| Information disclosure | any token reads another tenant's task or result by ID | task reads require `task.tenantId` equal to the resolved tenant; foreign and missing tasks answer identically | binding-scope e2e and controller tests |
| Elevation of privilege | a binding-scoped workload token reaches admin, another topic, webhooks, subscriptions, gRPC streams or worker promotion | ADR 0003 claim contract and route allow-list | binding-scope unit, middleware and e2e tests |
| Information disclosure | any token reuses another tenant's `idempotencyKey` and receives that tenant's task (payload, `tenantId`) | replay only when `task.tenantId` equals the caller's tenant, in every backend; otherwise 409 `idempotency_conflict` with no task or ID; Publish binding keys namespaced `tid\x00eventType\x00key`; NUL refused in client keys; binding replay also requires the token's command | repository unit tests (Pebble, sharded, Redis, `EnqueueWithID`), controller tests, idempotency e2e on the production router |
| Information disclosure (residual) | a non-binding token learns from the 409 that a raw legacy key exists in another tenant | one bit only (never the task, ID or tenant); binding keys are namespaced and cannot hit another tenant; tenant-namespacing legacy keys needs a dual-read migration | accepted residual, ADR 0003 |
| Information disclosure | a follower forwards the bearer token to a host chosen by a request or a stale/forged leader hint (SSRF) | target must equal a configured `RAFT_PEER_HTTP_ADDRS` value other than self; malformed peers excluded; no environment proxy; no redirects followed | leaderforward unit tests (unconfigured, trailing slash, self, empty, malformed, redirect) |
| Spoofing / elevation of privilege | client sends `X-CodeQ-Forwarded` to skip checks on the leader | the header carries no authority; the leader re-runs authentication, the binding allow-list and controller rules; on a follower it only yields 503 | three-voter test: forged header with bad token is 401, cross-tenant heartbeat is `not-owner` |
| Denial of service | forwarding loop or amplification between voters | one hop only: a forwarded request is never forwarded again (503 `leader_unavailable`, `Retry-After: 1`); per-request timeout 10 s (claims `waitSeconds` + 10 s) | loop tests on single, batch and claim routes |
| Denial of service | large bodies buffered for replay | at most 16 MiB buffered; larger bodies that must be forwarded get 413; unauthenticated requests are refused before the gate | body-limit unit and cluster tests |
| Information disclosure | forwarding logs or metrics leak credentials | one bounded log line per decision without `Authorization`, body or token; metric labels are route templates and fixed results | log-redaction unit test |
| Information disclosure (residual) | the bearer token crosses one more in-cluster HTTP hop (follower to leader) | same trust zone and transport as the existing edge to `codeq:8080` hop; configured peers only | accepted residual, platform ADR-0022 C1.5 |

Tenant resolution occurs only after the configured validator accepts the token.
It does not weaken route scopes, worker event types, admin scope, or
storage-level tenant prefixes; idempotent replay is bound to the resolved
tenant (ADR 0003). A global administrator remains bound to the
resolved tenant unless a separately reviewed global route says otherwise.

## Token-producer verification

- JWKS producer tokens expose their raw `jwt.MapClaims` to the resolver after
  issuer, audience, signature, and expiry checks.
- Static tokens expose only operator-configured raw claims and use the same
  resolver; they are not a production identity substitute.
- Producer-as-worker copies the already validated producer raw claims and then
  re-runs the same resolver at the worker boundary.
- HTTP and both gRPC handshakes reject invalid tenant claims before scheduling,
  claiming, results, subscriptions, or topic administration can execute.

## Review record

The owner waived independent security and peer-review gates and accepted the
documented T4 risk. That waiver is not an independent review or sign-off. No
GCP, Kubernetes, deployment, workload, or production validation is part of this
evidence.
